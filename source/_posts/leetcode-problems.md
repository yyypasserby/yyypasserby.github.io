[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) is a famous programming training website for many IT practitioners to improve their coding skills and the ability to solve practical problems.

After I finished my training, I found there would be more and more people trying to use **Leetcode** to practise. So I just collect my experience on [my github](https://github.com/yyypasserby) in this [repo](https://github.com/yyypasserby/leetcode-autocommit) with **solutions** and some **analysis**. What I want is to share the solution with other programmers and find out more and more interesting and efficient algorithms.

Again,

**Leetcode:** [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)

**My Solutions:** [https://github.com/yyypasserby/leetcode-autocommit](https://github.com/yyypasserby/leetcode-autocommit)
